# LunchBuddy

Welcome to Lunch Buddy! An app that connects employees for lunch!

In today's fast-paced corporate landscape, finding genuine ways to connect with our colleagues can be a challenge. Opportunites to engage with other employees outside of our direct teams are also limited. The LunchBuddy aims to bridge this gap by facilitating shared lunch experiences amongst employees at the workplace. This enhances workplace cohesion and cultivates relationships beyond our immediate circles.

An intelligent matching algorithm matches employees with colleagues who are available during the same lunchtime slot. For now, the app assumes that there is a workplace cafeteria which is where employees will meet up for their lunch.
